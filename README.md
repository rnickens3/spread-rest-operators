## User Stories
1. You should have a function named uniteUnique.
2. The uniteUnique function should accept two or more arrays as arguments.
3. The function should return a new array that contains unique values from the argument arrays, in the order they are first found in the arguments. For example, an input like [1, 2, 4], [2, 3, 5] would have an output of [1, 2, 4, 3, 5].
